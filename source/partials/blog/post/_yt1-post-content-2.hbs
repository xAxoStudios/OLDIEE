    Unboxing is the unpacking of products, especially high tech consumer
    products, where the process is captured on video and uploaded to the
    Internet. The item is then also explained in detail and also can sometimes
    be demonstrated as well.
  </p>

  <p>Yahoo Tech places the first unboxing video to be for the Nokia E61
    cellphone in 2006.. According to Google Trends, searches for the term
    "unboxing" began to surface in the final quarter of 2006. Early unboxing
    videos focused mainly either on gadgets or fashion items. However, once the
    trend took off, unboxing videos were available for, as Yahoo's Deb Amien put
    it, "nearly every thing that is available for purchase." By 2014 the
    popularity of the videos were such that some companieshad been known to
    upload unboxing videos for their own products, whilst others sent products
    to uploaders for free.
  </p>

  <p>Some consider the popularity of this practice is due to the ability of
    showing the product exactly for what it is without any adulteration
    advertisers usually make around the product. Being able to see what the
    customer is getting "can contribute to the decision process." Some users
    have tried to make these unboxings more interesting by adding special
    effects or doing them in different ways, such as an underwater unboxing of a
    waterproof smartphone.

  <p>The growth of E-commerce has also been a major factor contributing to the
    rise of unboxing. Direct-to-Consumer companies needed a way to better
    connect with their customers emotionally and create a positive buying
    experience. This has lead to many D2C companies investing in packaging
    design to serve as a marketing asset for their products. The more engaging
    and cool the packaging is, the more likely consumers will record unboxing
    videos of their product and ultimately drive more buyers to the company.

  <p>Packaging manufacturers are also increasingly aware of the role of 'the
    unboxing trend' in their development, and are continually improving their
    technologies to meet the demand for higher quality printed packages. Boxes
    are no longer just a transportation tool - they are a valuable marketing
    billboard delivered right to the customers.
