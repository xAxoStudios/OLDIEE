  <p class="!mt-0">Unboxing is the unpacking of products, especially high tech
    consumer products, where the process is captured on video and uploaded to
    the Internet. The item is then also explained in detail and also can
    sometimes be demonstrated as well. Yahoo Tech places the first unboxing
    video to be for the Nokia E61 cellphone in 2006.. According to Google
    Trends, searches for the term "unboxing" began to surface in the final
    quarter of 2006. Early unboxing videos focused mainly either on gadgets or
    fashion items. However, once the trend took off, unboxing videos were
    available for, as Yahoo's Deb Amien put it, "nearly every thing that is
    available for purchase." By 2014 the popularity of the videos were such that
    some companieshad been known to upload unboxing videos for their own
    products, whilst others sent products to uploaders for free.</p>

  <p>Some consider the popularity of this practice is due to the ability of
    showing the product exactly for what it is without any adulteration
    advertisers usually make around the product. Being able to see what the
    customer is getting "can contribute to the decision process." Some users
    have tried to make these unboxings more interesting by adding special
    effects or doing them in different ways, such as an underwater unboxing of a
    waterproof smartphone.</p>

  <p>The growth of E-commerce has also been a major factor contributing to the
    rise of unboxing. Direct-to-Consumer companies needed a way to better
    connect with their customers emotionally and create a positive buying
    experience. This has lead to many D2C companies investing in packaging
    design to serve as a marketing asset for their products. The more engaging
    and cool the packaging is, the more likely consumers will record unboxing
    videos of their product and ultimately drive more buyers to the company.</p>

  <p>Packaging manufacturers are also increasingly aware of the role of 'the
    unboxing trend' in their development, and are continually improving their
    technologies to meet the demand for higher quality printed packages. Boxes
    are no longer just a transportation tool - they are a valuable marketing
    billboard delivered right to the customers.
